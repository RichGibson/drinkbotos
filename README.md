# DrinkbotOS

> *Cocktail robotics made simple.*

DrinkbotOS is the open-source control software for the **Hello Drinkbot** hardware platform. It replaces earlier Bartendro-based systems with a modern, extensible, API-first foundation that supports both basic cocktail-making and delightfully weird robotic interfaces.

## 🧠 What is DrinkbotOS?
DrinkbotOS is designed to:
- Control pumps, relays, and valves to dispense liquids precisely
- Provide a RESTful API for programmatic drink requests
- Offer a friendly web interface for manual operation
- Support creative extensions like chatbot bartenders, physical controllers, or remote pour requests

## 🍹 Core Features
- 📋 Ingredient & Cocktail database (with unit support)
- 🧪 API-first architecture for UI, hardware, and chat integrations
- 🖥️ Web interface with admin & user modes
- 📦 Modular backend in Python (Flask + SQLite)
- 🪝 Personality hooks for custom bartender behaviors

## 🚀 Getting Started
```bash
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
$ conda activate drinkbotos
$ flask run
```

## ⚙️ API Highlights
- `GET /api/cocktails` — List all cocktails
- `GET /api/ingredients/loaded` — Show what's currently on tap
- `POST /api/dispense` — Dispense a cocktail
- `GET /api/status` — System status and readiness

## 🤝 Acknowledgments
DrinkbotOS builds on the ideas and inspiration of the **Bartendro** project by Party Robotics. While no code was reused, Bartendro's open-source legacy helped spark the creation of Hello Drinkbot.
